# Robots-vs-Dinosaurs

devCodeCamp project two: using classes design a simple fighting game

User is prompted to choose a battle between 1 or 3 (a fleet) robots vs 1 or 3 (a herd) dinosaurs. 
If choosing a robot, allowed to pick 1 of 3 weapons with tradeoff between damage and hit chance 
If choose fleet or herd, attributes and weapons randomly chosen within a range. 

Battle then plays out in console output until one side, Team Robot or Team Dinosaur, is declared the winner.
